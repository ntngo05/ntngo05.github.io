# Nathan Ngo's Portfolio

I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science. I plan on graduating around 2028.

## Favorite Labs

* Lab 4, Part 2

This was one of my favorite labs because this was the first lab that really challenged our problem solving skills at the time. We were given no instructions and no TODO comments and only a prompt stating that we must use several if statements. With our knowledge we needed to figure out how to determine whether the guessed number is too high or too low or if it was indeed the correct number.

* Lab 8

The entirety of lab 8 was one of my favorites because of how fun it was to play around with it. Lab 8 was fun playing with command lines but it was more fun trying to figure out how to get the sum of all of the command line arguments and taking the average. It was difficult at first and really triggered our problem solving skills to work out a solution.

* Lab 7, Part 2

This lab was one of my favorites because it was also fun to play around with. Even though we did not manage to get the results we wanted, it really was like a puzzle piecing different functions and our knowledge together to determine whether or not you could park at a street at a given time, day, and week. This is one of the only labs that actually felt useful, like a real life application, and that this could be applied somewhere in the future.
